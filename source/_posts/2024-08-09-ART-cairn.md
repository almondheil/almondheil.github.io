I made a teeny little cairn on a walk the other day, and I put it on my todo
list to try and pixelart one at some point. This is the result of that attempt,
and I'm okay with it! It's nice to have something to break up all the green
stuff I've had up to this point.

Also, I have the picture of the original cairn that inspired this still lying
around! This one isn't as impressively balanced as the one I tried to pixelart,
but I made most of this one so I'm pretty proud of my meager stacking skills.
