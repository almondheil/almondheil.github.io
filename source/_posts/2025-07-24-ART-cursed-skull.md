I might get to play this as a D&D character.

It is so exciting to maybe be able to get back into D&D, and it's so fun to make art for the first time in a long time. I am proud of this one.

I stayed up until 00:18 today and I have to wake up at 5:30 work work. bad decisions! but it'll be worth it, I did a thing that was good for me.
