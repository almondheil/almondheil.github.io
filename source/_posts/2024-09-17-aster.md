I've been busy with school and work so far this semester, but this afternoon I really needed a break
so I decided to make another little piece of art. Like a lot of the other stuff I've posted so far,
it's based on a plant that I saw when I was walking around. This one was growing outside of
Bucksbaum, the building that holds theater, art, and music classes.

That whole patch of flowers is wonderful--lots of honey bees and a beautiful assortment of flowering
plants, plus some interesting art projects set up outside. It's sad to think about how all those
flowers are gonna stop blooming as we go towards fall and winter, but at least I took a while to
appreciate this one today.
