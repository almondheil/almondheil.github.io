This is a silly character I decided to draw after my friend sent me a picture of some pitcher plants they had
run into. I started off trying to draw the pitcher plant, but then I decided it looked like the tail of some
creature and chose to go in that direction instead.

Here's the original photo of the pitcher plants. Aren't they cool?
