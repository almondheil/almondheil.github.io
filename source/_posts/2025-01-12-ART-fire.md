I was watching the fire today and decided I wanted to try and draw it here. It went iffy, but I'm going to put it up anyway
and get the poison out. 

This is I think the first time I'm experimenting with 

- transparency
- dithering (by hand, I think aseprite has tools for it but I'm not using them yet)

and it went not as bad as it could've! I think it came out pretty visually messy, but it's still a thing that I've done and that's worthwhile.
