Prickly pear, also known as Nopal, is an adorable little cactus that I've always admired.
It's so cute! I have a real soft spot for cacti.

Did you know that "nopales" also refers to a food? It's made by taking pads from the plant,
slicing off all the needles, then chopping them up and cooking them. 
I've never tried any, but I hear they're really good!
