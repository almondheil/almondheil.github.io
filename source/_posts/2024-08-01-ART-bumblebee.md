I'm not proud of this at all, but I felt like I had to get it done. I started this on Jul 30 and it was supposed
to be part of my personal challenge to make a piece of pixelart every day of July, but it didn't work out
because everything got diffucult at work. It's still difficult, but I wanted to get it done today and it's at least
no longer sitting on my computer unfinished.

But yayyyy, it's a bumblebee! They're cute little bugs, I'm just sad I didn't make something I'm proud of.
