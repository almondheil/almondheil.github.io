It was my birthday recently, and I got a Wacom tablet because I wanted to play around with doing more organic stuff with pixelart. So now I have brush dynamics (I think they're called), which is awesome!

I also randomly stumbled across the shading feature Aseprite has. I used it to make this, I just drew a blob and then drew eyes and a nose and teeth on it. It's a cool technique that I want to learn more about, I think it has potential!
