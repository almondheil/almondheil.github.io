Today, I realized that I haven't tried to do any art since September, which is pretty sad. So I ignored all the work
I still need to do and made this thing!

I decided on a casette tape because I just watched this amazing youtube video that covered making a cursed cassette tape where the tape is loose inside.

I decided to animate mine after drawing the initial sprite, and I eventually decided to add these floating music notes to give it more life.

I was also inspired by the B-side tapes from Celeste, and I referenced this other image for the colorscheme I chose.
