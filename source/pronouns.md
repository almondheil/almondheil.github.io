title: Pronouns are complicated

> They/them? What sort of attention-seeking and/or delusional kid are you?

If you think that, or something more nuanced than the straw man I
just constructed, I can't stop you. You're free to do whatever you
want, and I can't make you use the pronouns I like.

Still, I can ask you. That's all I'm here to say--if you respect me
as a person and want me to recognize that, please use the pronouns
I ask you to. If you decide not to use them, go for it. Just know that
this is how I'll read it.

# "nonbinary"

When I tell someone that my pronouns are they/them, it makes a lot of
sense for them to assume that I would describe myself as nonbinary.
If "man" and "woman" are binary genders and I'm not one of those, doesn't that make me nonbinary?

By that definition, yes. However, despite how logical it is, I've
spent a long time reflecting on this in particular and I'm not sure
that almost set-theoretical definition is useful when I think about
my own identity.

I don't have a real conclusion here, just a messy pile of thoughts
that I'm trying to summarize well enough to tell people. 

I also will never treat someone misunderstanding this weird loophole
of my identity the same way as someone purposefully not using my
pronouns, I just want these paragraphs to be out in the world for now.
