title: Pronouns are complicated

> They/them? What sort of attention-seeking and/or delusional kid are you?

If you think that, or something more nuanced than the straw man I
just constructed, I can't stop you. You're free to do whatever you
want, and I can't make you use the pronouns I like.

Still, I can ask you. That's all I'm here to say--if you respect me
as a person and want me to recognize that, please use the pronouns
I ask you to. If you decide not to use them, go for it. Just know that
this is how I'll read it.
