A website where I can put my silly ideas about computers (or anything else I feel like, there are no rules).

Hosted through GitHub pages, <https://almendra.dev>.

Theme is based on [no style, please!](https://riggraz.dev/no-style-please/) by [Riccardo Graziosi](https://github.com/riggraz).

# Building locally

Install `ruby` from system repos, that should give you the `bundler` command.

Install dependencies:

```
$ bundle install
```

Then, run the dev webserver on localhost:

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

(run that from the root of the repo so `_config.yml` is in your current directory)
